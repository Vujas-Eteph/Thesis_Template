# Thesis_Template
My variation of the - classicthesis - LaTeX template

# What is the difference between this version and the classicthesis template?
- Added lines numbers, only when using the draft mode - better for feedback with superviser IMO
- Changed the default font of numbers that are associated with sections, subsections, equations, figures and tables. This is better IMO as it's closer to the usual numbering font found in CS papers. Also equations are now always centered by default.
- Similarly for the captions, which are not indented anymore.
- Changed some colors that look IMO better along with some font sizes.
- Larger area for the text, and less margin for the margin notes.
